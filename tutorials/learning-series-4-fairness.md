# 🧠 Learning Series #4: What Makes a Model “Fair” in Pathology AI?

## ⚖️ The Concept
**Fairness** in AI means your model performs equitably across different subgroups — whether by race, sex, age, or other clinically important factors. In pathology, this could mean ensuring your model is not just accurate for one demographic, but for *everyone*.

## 🧬 Why It Matters in Pathology
- Reduces disparities in diagnostic accuracy
- Builds trust among patients and providers
- Aligns with ethical and regulatory standards (e.g., FDA, NIH)

## 🔍 Real-World Risks
- A model trained mostly on white male samples may underperform on female or minority populations
- Overfitting to institutional data can miss inter-population variation

## 📊 How to Audit for Fairness
- **Disaggregate performance** by group (e.g., race-specific accuracy)
- Use confusion matrices for each subgroup
- Plot ROC curves per demographic
- Monitor false positives and false negatives across cohorts

## 🧰 Tools You Can Try
- scikit-learn's `classification_report` by group
- `Fairlearn` and `Aequitas` (fairness audit libraries)
- Stratified plots in matplotlib/seaborn

## 💬 Example Questions to Ask
- Does my model predict recurrence better in one race or sex group?
- Is performance consistent across tissue types or sequencing platforms?
