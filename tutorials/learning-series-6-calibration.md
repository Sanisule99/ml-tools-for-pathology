# 🧠 Learning Series #6: How Do You Calibrate an ML Model in Pathology?

## 🔍 The Concept
**Calibration** means aligning the confidence scores of a model with the actual likelihood of being correct. In pathology, this is critical because a model that predicts “99% lung” should actually be right ~99% of the time.

A well-calibrated model ensures its probability outputs are trustworthy for clinical interpretation.

## 🔬 Why It Matters in Pathology
- Prevents overconfident but wrong predictions
- Builds trust in ML decision support tools
- Allows integration into clinical workflows (tumor board discussions, QI projects)

## ⚙️ Common Calibration Methods
- **Platt Scaling**: Logistic regression on top of model outputs
- **Isotonic Regression**: Non-parametric calibration, flexible for complex data
- **Temperature Scaling**: Widely used for deep learning

## 📊 How to Assess Calibration
- **Calibration curves / reliability diagrams**
- **Expected Calibration Error (ECE)**
- Comparing predicted vs observed probabilities

## 🧰 Tools You Can Try
- scikit-learn: `CalibratedClassifierCV`
- `netcal` library for advanced calibration
- Calibration curve plotting in matplotlib

## 💡 Example in Pathology
- A tissue-of-origin classifier might be 90% confident in “colon” for a sample.  
- Without calibration: That 90% could mean it's only right 70% of the time.  
- With calibration: Predictions align more closely with reality.

## 🧠 Pathologist Takeaway
Calibration ensures **confidence scores are clinically meaningful**.  
It’s the difference between “black-box probability” and a result you can trust at tumor board.
