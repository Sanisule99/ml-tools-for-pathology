# Machine Learning Tools for Pathology

This repository contains practical workflows that demonstrate how machine learning can support diagnostic pathology and pathology informatics.  
Each notebook is designed to be accessible for trainees, researchers, and clinicians interested in computational pathology.

## üî¨ What‚Äôs Inside
- **Copy Number Alteration (CNA) Burden Analysis**  
  Pan-cancer pipeline using MSK-CHORD to explore CNA burden, histologic grade, and survival outcomes.

- **Tissue-of-Origin Classifier**  
  Integrated GTEx + TCGA RNA expression data for calibrated tumor classification.  
  ![Confusion matrix](figures/confusion_matrix.png)

- **Explainable AI for Cytomorphology**  
  Bone marrow cytology classifier with SHAP & Grad-CAM visualizations.

## üìò Why This Matters
These workflows illustrate how **bioinformatics and pathology intersect**:  
- Pathologists can explore omics data alongside morphology.  
- Models are designed to be interpretable and reproducible.  
- Supports diagnostic reasoning, not just black-box predictions.
