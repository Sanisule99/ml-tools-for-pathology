## Pathology & Foundation Models â€” Key Points
- CLIP-style zero-shot can help with label-scarce tasks, but prompts matter.
- Domain shift is real: consider histology-specific pretraining when available.
- SAM can assist with nucleus/tissue segmentation; pair with heuristics.
- Ethics: guardrails for synthetic data and prompt leakage.
