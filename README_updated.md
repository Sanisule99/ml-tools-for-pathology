# 🧠 Machine Learning Tools for Pathology Informatics

This repository offers open-source, easy-to-follow tutorials and tools for applying machine learning (ML) in **pathology and clinical research** settings. Whether you're a student, researcher, or practicing pathologist, these workflows are built to be accessible — especially in **low-resource** or real-world environments.

## 📘 What's Inside

| Tutorial | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [`CNA_Burden_Recurrence_Predictor.ipynb`](tutorials/CNA_Burden_Recurrence_Predictor.ipynb) | Predict disease recurrence in breast cancer using somatic copy number alteration (SCNA) burden and clinical data |
| *(Coming Soon)* GTEx IHC Marker Explorer | Analyze tissue- and sex-specific expression of diagnostic immunohistochemical markers using GTEx |
| *(Coming Soon)* Tissue-of-Origin Classifier | Build and interpret an ML model using GTEx + TCGA to classify tissue origin from gene expression |

## 💡 Why This Matters

Modern pathology increasingly relies on informatics and data science. These tools aim to:
- **Democratize ML in pathology**
- Help you **reuse public data** or **analyze your own**
- Run on **modest hardware** (no GPU/cloud required)
- Support **education, QI projects, and translational research**
