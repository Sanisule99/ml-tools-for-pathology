# 🛠 How to Use These Tools in Your Own Practice or Research

This repository is designed for:
- Pathologists, residents, and medical students
- Researchers working in clinical genomics or bioinformatics
- Low-resource or real-world hospital and public health settings

The goal is to make machine learning tools more accessible and adaptable to support clinical research, decision-making, and diagnostics.

## 📁 1. Get the Code

You can either:
- **Download the repository as ZIP** and unzip locally, or
- **Clone it with Git**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ml-tools-for-pathology.git
cd ml-tools-for-pathology
```

---

## 📦 2. Install Required Packages

You can use pip in your terminal or Jupyter notebook:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

To run the notebooks:
- Use **Jupyter Notebook**, **JupyterLab**, or **Google Colab**.

## 📊 3. Prepare Your Own Data

Each tutorial includes a section:
```
🧠 Use With Your Own Data
```

There, you can:
- Replace the public dataset with your own local `.csv` or `.tsv` file.
- Adjust column names to match your schema (e.g., "Recurrence", "Histologic Grade").
- Retrain or reuse the ML models on your data with no coding changes required beyond loading your file.

## ⚙️ 4. Running a Notebook

In Jupyter or Colab:
1. Open a `.ipynb` file from the `tutorials/` folder.
2. Run each cell one by one (Shift + Enter).
3. Review output visualizations and model performance.
4. Modify parameters or input data as needed.

## 🧠 Tips for Low-Resource Environments

- All code is **CPU-friendly** (no GPU/cloud required).
- Notebooks run in **<2GB RAM** and are tested on laptops with basic specs.
- You can run them fully in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) with no setup.
